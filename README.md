# Hosting an HTML Website on AWS EC2

This guide details the steps to host a static HTML website on an Amazon EC2 instance, using a robust AWS infrastructure that includes a 2-tier VPC, Auto Scaling, Load Balancing, and SSL security.

## Architecture Overview

The architecture consists of a 2-tier VPC setup designed for security and scalability. The setup includes:

- **Private and Public Subnets**: Ensuring secure and separated environments for public access and backend processes.
- **NAT Gateways**: Providing internet access to instances in private subnets without exposing them to incoming internet traffic.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Distributing incoming application traffic across multiple targets, increasing the availability of your application.
- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**: Automatically adjusting the number of EC2 instances in response to traffic demand.
- **SSL/TLS Security**: Utilizing AWS Certificate Manager for managing secure communications.

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: VPC Configuration

- **Create a VPC**: Set up a VPC with both public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones.
- **Set Up Route Tables**: Configure route tables for public and private subnets.

### Step 2: NAT and Security Groups

- **Create NAT Gateways**: Deploy NAT gateways in each public subnet to allow outbound internet access for instances in the private subnets.
- **Configure Security Groups**: Define security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances.

### Step 3: Load Balancer and Domain Configuration

- **Application Load Balancer Setup**: Create an ALB with target groups pointing to EC2 instances in the private subnets.
- **Domain Name Configuration**: Use AWS Route 53 to manage the DNS settings for your domain.
- **SSL Certificate**: Register and manage an SSL certificate using AWS Certificate Manager.

### Step 4: Launch Templates and Auto Scaling

- **Launch Template Creation**: Define an EC2 launch template that specifies the instance configuration, including AMI, instance type, and security settings.
- **Auto Scaling Setup**: Create an Auto Scaling Group using the launch template to maintain instance health and capacity.

### Step 5: Deployment Script

- **Script Execution**: Run the deployment script to install and configure the web server (Apache or Nginx) on EC2 instances and to deploy your HTML content.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y httpd
cd /var/www/html
wget https://example.com/path/to/your/site.zip
unzip site.zip
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```

## Accessing Your Website

Once deployed, your website can be accessed via the domain name configured in Route 53, securely over HTTPS.

## Maintaining and Monitoring

- **Regular Updates**: Keep your system and application up to date with the latest security patches.
- **Monitoring**: Utilize AWS CloudWatch to monitor the health and performance of your EC2 instances and other AWS resources.
